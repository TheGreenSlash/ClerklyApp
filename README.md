Clerkly - A desktop based accounting software
I made this app or atleast worked on it as a project for my 6th semester.
As of right now this is an incomplete project but it still provides the basic functionality of an accounting software with creating and recording invoices.
Some feature I want to implement as soon I get the time include inventory management, payroll system, an active payment collections system, along with the ability to print 
create digital invoices.
This app was made entirely with C# and WinForms. It may not be upto modern standards.
